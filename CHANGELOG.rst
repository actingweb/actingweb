CHANGELOG
=========

Apr 2, 2017
-----------
- Changed license to BSD after approval from Cisco Systems
- Fix bug in deletion of trust relationship that would not delete subscription
- Add support for GET param ?refresh=true for web-based sessions to ignore set cookie and do oauth
- Fix bug in oauth.oauthDELETE() returning success when >299 is returned from upstream

Mar 11, 2017
------------
- Fix bug in aw_actor_callbacks.py on does exist test after db refactoring
- Fix bug in handling of www/init form to set properties
- Add support to enforce that creator (in actor) is unique (Config.unique_creator bool)
- Add support to enforce that a creator field set to "creator" is overwritten if property "email" is set 
  (Config.force_email_prop_as_creator bool, default True). Note that username for basic login then changes from
  creator to the value of email property. 
  This functionality can be useful if actor is created by trustee and email is set later
- Add new db_actor.py function getByCreator() to allow retrieving an actor based on the creator value


Feb 25, 2016
------------
- Major refactoring of all database code 
  - All db entities are now accessible only from the actingweb/* libraries
  - Each entity can be accessed one by one (e.g. trust.py exposes trust class)
    and as a list (e.g. trust.py exposes trusts class)
  - actorId and any parameters that identify the entity must be set when the class is
    instantiated  
  - get() must be called on the object to retrieve it from the database and the object
    is returned as a dictionary
  - Subsequent calls to get() will return the dictionary without database access, but
    any changes will be synced to database immediately
  - The actingweb/* libraries do not contain any database-specific code, but imports
    a db library that exposes the barebone db operations per object
  - The google datastore code can be found in actingweb/db_gae
  - Each database entity has its own .py file exposing get(), modify(), create(), delete()
    and some additional search/utility functions where needed
  - These db classes do not do anything at init, and get() and create() must include all parameters
  - The database handles are kept in the object, so modify() and delete() require a get() or create()
    before they can be called
- Currently, Google Datastore is the only supported db backend, but the db_* code can now fairly
  easily be adapted to new databases

--------------
- Added support for /resources with on_aw_resources.py in on_aw/ to hook into GET, DELETE, and POST requests to /resources

Sep 25, 2016
--------------
- Added use_cache=False to all db operations to avoid cache issue when there are multiple instances of same app in gae

Sep 4, 2016
--------------
- Refactoring of creation of trust:

  - ensure that a peer cannot have more than one relationship
  - ensure that a secret can only be used for one relationship

Aug 28, 2016
--------------
- Major refactoring of auth.py. Only affects how init_actingweb() is used, see function docs

Aug 21, 2016: New features
--------------------------
- Removed the possibility of setting a secret when initiating a new relationship, as well as ability to change secret. This is to avoid the possibility of detecting existing secrets (from other peers) by testing secrets

Aug 15, 2016: Bug fixes
------------------------
- Added new acl["approved"] flag to auth.py indicating whether an authenticated peer has been approved
- Added new parameter to the authorise() function to turn off the requirement that peer has been approved to allow access
- Changed default relationship to the lowest level (associate) and turned off default approval of the default relationship
- Added a new authorisation check to subscriptions to make sure that only peers with access to a path are allowed to subscribe to those paths
- Added a new approval in trust to allow non-approved peers to delete their relationship (in case they want to "withdraw" their relationship request)
- Fixed uncaught json exception in createRemoteSubscription()
- Fixed possibility of subpath being None instead of '' in auth.py
- Fixed handling of both bool json type and string bool value for approved parameter for trust relationships

  - New deleteRemoteSubscription() in actor.py
  - Added deletion to actor.delete()
  - New handler for DELETE of /callbacks in aw-actor-callbacks.py
  - New on_delete_callbacks() in on_aw_callbacks.py

Aug 6, 2016: Bug fixes
----------------------------
- Fixed bug where /meta/nonexistent resulted in 500

Aug 3, 2016: New features
----------------------------
- Support for doing callbacks when registering diffs
  - New function in actor.py: callbackSubscription()
  - Added defer of callbacks to avoid stalling responses when adding diffs
  - Added new function getTrustRelationship() to get one specific relationship based on peerid (instead of searching using getTrustRelationships())
- Improved diff registration
  - Totally rewrote registerDiffs() to register diffs for subscriptions that are not exact matches (i.e. broader/higher-level and more specific)
  - Added debug logging to trace how diffs are registered
- Owner-based access only to /callbacks/subscriptions
- Support for handling callbacks for subscriptions
  - New function in on_aw_callbacks.py: on_post_subscriptions() for handling callbacks on subscriptions
  - Changed aw-actor-callbacks.py to handle POSTs to /callbacks/subscriptions and forward those to on_post_subscriptions()

Aug 3, 2016: Bug fixes
----------------------------
- Added no cache to the rest of subscriptionDiffs DB operations to make sure that deferred subscription callbacks don't mess up sequencing
- Changed meta/raml to meta/specification to allow any type of specification language

Aug 1, 2016: New features
----------------------------
- Added support for GET on subscriptions as peer, generic register diffs function, as well as adding diffs when changing /properties. Also added support for creator initiating creation of a subscription by distingushing on POST to /subscriptions (as creator to inititate a subscription with another peer) and to /subscriptions/<peerid> (as peer to create subscription)
- Subscription is also created when initiating a remote subscription (using callback bool to set flag to identify a subscription where callback is expected). Still missing support for sending callbacks (high/low/none), as well as processing callbacks
- Added support for sequence number in subscription, so that missing diffs can be detected. Specific diffs can be retrieved by doing GET as peer on /subscriptions/<peerid>/<subid>/<seqnr> (and the diff will be cleared)

Jul 27, 2016: New features
----------------------------
- Started adding log statements to classes and methods
- Added this file to track changes
- Added support for requesting creation of subscriptions, GETing (with search) all subscriptions as creator (not peer), as well as deletion of subscriptions when an actor is deleted (still remaining GET all relationship as peer, GET on relationship to get diffs, DELETE subscription as peer, as well as mechanism to store diffs)

Jul 27, 2016: Bug fixes
----------------------------
- Changed all ndb.fetch() calls to not include a max item number
- Cleaned up actor delete() to go directly on database to delete all relevant items
- Fixed a bug where the requested peer would not store the requesting actor's mini-app type in db (in trust)
- Added use_cache=False in all trust.py ndb calls to get rid of the cache issues experienced when two different threads communicate to set up a trust
- Added a new check and return message when secret is not included in an "establish trust" request (requestor must always include secret)

July 12, 2016: New features
----------------------------
- config.py cleaned up a bit

July 12, 2016: Bug fixes
----------------------------
- Fix in on_aw_oauth_success where token can optionally supplied (first time oauth was done the token has not been flushed to db)
- Fix in on_aw_oauth_success where login attempt with wrong Spark user did not clear the cookie_redirect variable
- Fixed issue with wrong Content-Type header for GET and DELETE messages without json body
