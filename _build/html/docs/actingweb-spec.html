<h3>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The ActingWeb micro-services model and protocol defines a bot-to-bot and
micro-service-to-micro-service communication that allows extreme
distribution of data and functionality. This makes it very suitable for
holding small pieces of sensitive data on behalf of a user or “things”
(as in Internet of Things). These sensitive data can then be used and
shared in a very granular and controlled way through the secure and
distributed ActingWeb REST protocol. This allows you to expose e.g. your
location data from your phone directly on the Internet (protected by the ActingWeb
security framework) and to be used by other services <cite>on your
choosing</cite>. You can at any time revoke access to your data for one
particular service without influencing anything else.</p>
<p>The programming model in ActingWeb is based on an extreme focus on only
representing one small set of functionality and for only one user or
entity. This is achieved by not allowing any other way of calling the
service (in ActingWeb called a “mini-application”) than through a user
and the mini-app’s REST interface (a user’s instance of a
mini-application is called an <cite>actor</cite> in ActingWeb). From a practical
point of view, getting xyz’s location through the REST protocol is as
simple as doing a GET
<cite>http://mini-app-url/xyz/properties/location</cite>.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no way of getting xyz’s and yyz’s location
information in one request, and the security model enforces access based
on user (i.e. actor), so even if you have access to
<cite>http://mini-app-url/xyz/properties/location</cite>, you will not have
access to <cite>http://mini-app-url/yyz/properties/location</cite>.</p>
<p>Any functionality desired across actors, for example xyz sharing
location information with yyz <cite>MUST</cite> be done through the ActingWeb
REST protocol. However, since the ActingWeb service-to-service REST
protocol is standardised, <cite>any</cite> service implementing the protocol
can easily share data with other services.</p>
<p>The ActingWeb REST protocol specifies a set of default endpoints (like
<cite>/properties</cite>, <cite>/trust</cite>, <cite>/subscriptions</cite> etc) that
are used to implement the service-to-service communication, as well as a
set of suggested endpoints (like <cite>/resources</cite>, <cite>/actions</cite>
etc) where the mini-applications can expose their own functionality. All
exchanges are based on REST principles and a set of flows are built into
the protocol that support exchanging data, establishing trust between
actors (per actor, not per mini-application), as well as subscribing to
changes.</p>
<p>The security model is based on trust between actors, not
mini-applications. This means that each instance of the mini-application
holding the sensitive data for one particular person or thing
<cite>must</cite> be connected through a trust relationship to another
ActingWeb actor, but it doesn’t have to be a mini-application of the
same type (like location sharing), but could be a location sharing actor
establishing a trust relationship with 911 authorities to allow
emergency services to always be able to look you up.</p>
<p>There are currently two ways of establishing trust between actors:
either through an explicit OAuth flow where an actor is tied to
somebody’s account somewhere else (like Google, Box.com, etc) or through
a flow where one actor requests a trust relationship with another, which
then needs to be approved either interactively by a user or
programatically through the REST interface.</p>
</section>
<section id="overview-of-operations">
<h3>Overview of operations<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-of-operations" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The ActingWeb is an application-layer communication protocol used
between independent software components that can reside on any
computer-powered device. These software components or services, referred
to as mini-applications, implement the ActingWeb protocol to expose
data, resources, and services to other ActingWeb mini-applications or to
clients of the ActingWeb services (that not themselves are ActingWeb
mini-applications). ActingWeb is targeted towards machine-to-machine
communication, and can be used to build Internet of Everything (IoT)
type functionality.</p>
<p>ActingWeb assumes a programming model where you can only access data and
services through individual instances of the mini-application and where
there is one and only one user or entity that is represented. That is, there
is no concept of “get all instances” of something, only “get this data
for this specific instance.”</p>
<p>Thus, in ActingWeb terminology, an <em>actor</em> is an instance that is
running and exposing the mini-application’s services for one specific
entity/user/device, i.e. a mini-application may implement location
awareness functionality, and a single actor (an instance of the
mini-application) may represent one physical mobile device and keep
track of that device’s current GPS position, as well as allow other
actors to access that device’s GPS position. This is contrary to typical
web applications, where one application normally implements a set of
functionality for many entities/users. However, another mini-application
could offer location services for users specifically (and not a device)
and then multiple location-aware devices and services associated with a
single user could serve data to that user’s actor. The scope of a
mini-application is thus not a rigid concept, but rather a design
principle.</p>
<p>In order to access an actor’s data, a set of credentials is required.
The credentials identifying the requesting actor are unique for the
relationship between the two actors. Each such relationship has a trust
level, controlling which level of access the requesting actor has to the
actor’s data. Hence, a mini-application is always contacted through a
specific actor, and the credentials give access to the actor’s data. The
actors establish trust relationships with each other in many-to-many
relationships where each relationship is bi-directional (optionally
one-way) and has a trust level. The trust relationship is then used as
authentication when requesting access. The mini-application itself
specifies which access rights are given to which data, resources, and
services for each trust level and thus outside the scope of this
document, while the method used to create a trust relationship is
specified in this document.</p>
<p>The mini-application functionality of the actor is accessed through a
set of pre-defined URIs. The ActingWeb protocol for interaction
<strong>between</strong> actors is based on RESTful principles, while RPC-style
methods like SOAP can also be exposed as part of the mini-applications
accessible functionality if desired. The ActingWeb protocol specifies a
basic set of URIs (<em>endpoints</em>) that must be supported.
Mini-applications may (indeed is likely to) offer also other resources
and services than those specified in this document.</p>
<p>Each actor implements one and only one mini-application. The
mini-application functionality and interface may be described in human
or machine-readable form, dependent on the preference of the creator. A
description of a mini-application is similar to the interface of a class
in object-oriented terminology and exhaustively describes the
mini-application so that it can be used by creators of other actors for
the purpose of communication between the actors.</p>
<p>Each actor also offers a subscription endpoint, where actors and clients
can request to be notified about changes to a given endpoint path (like
/resources/target/12345). The notification is either a callback to an
URI provided by the requestor or, optionally, as a subscription resource
that can be polled.</p>
<p>An actor typically resides on a web server and is thus accessible via a
root URI for that specific actor, ex.
<a class="reference external" href="https://actingweb.net/apps/app1/897JGHGY76HGhgK/">https://actingweb.net/apps/app1/897JGHGY76HGhgK/</a></p>
<p>An important aspect of actors is how they relate to traditional user
accounts found in interactive (and SOAP/REST-based) web sites and
services: In a classic web site/web service implementation, the root URL
is the entry point to a login page asking for login credentials or
authentication. Credentials, including a username, are thus required as
part of the web service request. An ActingWeb actor’s root URL will
typically not only identify the account in question, but the account’s
specific functionality, for example the voicemail inbox. The credentials
used to access the actor are never an account username and password, but
rather the credentials of a trust relationship that has been established
between the requesting and requested actor. This trust can for example
be established using OAuth or through an approval process as described
in this document.</p>

<section id="structure-of-the-protocol">
<h3>Structure of the Protocol<a class="headerlink" href="#structure-of-the-protocol" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>As a REST-based protocol, the ActingWeb protocol utilises the http
protocol specification. All communication between actors is based on
usage of the basic principles of an http envelope with a message type,
headers and corresponding values, and a payload. Http responses are also
re-used.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">Actor</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="o">----</span> <span class="n">http</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-----|</span> <span class="n">Actor</span> <span class="o">|</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><em>Figure, http(s) as transport</em></p>
<p>This specification defines the URI interface each actor must implement,
which http methods shall be used to accomplish what, which http response
codes shall be used in which situations, as well as definitions of the
representations to be used in http requests and responses. There is a
set of mandatory URI paths that any actor must respond to, as well as a
set of optional paths to be used for specific pre-defined purposes.</p>
<p>The protocol also specifies how trust relationships shall be
established, how to use them for authentication and authorisation, as
well as how they are terminated.</p>
<p>Finally, the protocol specifies what a subscription is, how a
subscription can be established, fulfilled, and cancelled.</p>

<section id="what-is-a-mini-application">
<h3>What Is a Mini-Application?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-mini-application" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The mini-application is the central element in the ActingWeb. The
concept is very flexible, practically any tiny functionality, like
holding one value, can be wrapped into a mini-application, or you can
create one actor implementing all the functionality you need. If you
have an existing web service, it may be tempting to just create one
ActingWeb mini-application to expose your web service in the ActingWeb.
However, you gain a lot more by creating mini-applications that follow
the principles of the ActingWeb: user-centric, atomic, 24x7 alive, and
isolated. These principles are explained in more detail further below.</p>
<p>The mini-application can in many ways be compared to a class from
object-oriented programming languages. The class has private and public
data, as well as methods that can be called with certain parameters and
return values. The mini-application offers the same (and more) through
an interface definition. A class has a name; the mini-application has a
type. Both can be instantiated, the class into an object, and the
mini-application into an actor.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-mini-application-s-type">
<h3>The Mini-Application’s Type<a class="headerlink" href="#the-mini-application-s-type" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each mini-application MUST have a type name in the form of a urn
prefixed with <cite>actingweb</cite>. A unique namespace MUST be chosen by
using either a rightfully owned domain name or email address. All other
urns are reserved for use by a coordinating body, currently
actingweb.org. Examples of valid mini-application types:
<cite>urn:actingweb:payment:creditcard</cite>,
<cite>urn:actingweb:mydomain.com:coolapps:app1</cite>,
<cite>urn:actingweb:user&#64;domain.com:myapp2</cite></p>
<p>Any given mini-application type can have zero, one, or many actual
implementations (for example in different programming languages, for
different server platforms etc). A mini-application type MUST correspond
to one and only one human- or machine-readable description.</p>
</section>
<section id="option-tags">
<h3>Option tags<a class="headerlink" href="#option-tags" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Option tags are textual tags indicating support for a specific
functionality as specified in this specification (i.e extensions). The
<em>/meta/actingweb/supported</em> path MUST return a list of comma-separated
option tags to indicate which OPTIONAL functionalities that the
mini-application has implemented and thus the actor supports.</p>
<p>The below table summarises all the option tags (and thus optional parts)
in this specification. Only the basic creation and deletion of an actor
and the /properties and /meta paths are mandatory to implement, thus
allowing the implementation of a very simple actor. Most actors will
also support /callbacks and maybe /www to allow interaction using web
pages and getting callback data from third party services. Third party
interactions will often be coupled with implementation of /oauth to
allow use of OAuth to get access.</p>

<h2>The Actor<a class="headerlink" href="#the-actor" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<section id="what-is-an-actor">
<h3>What is an Actor?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-an-actor" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>An actor is a running software component that is ready to respond to
external requests, as well as internal events or requests (for example
if residing on a mobile phone). The actor implements a small and finite
set of functionality with the purpose of offering parts or all of that
functionality to the outside world. An actor is not a replacement for a
SOAP or REST-based web service, and is not a part of a web site for
human interactions. Actors are made for machine-to-machine
communication, and is ideal for e.g. bot-to-bot communication.</p>
<p>Each actor is, in the object-oriented terminology, an instantiation of a
class, and thus can be seen as an object. The mini-application
definition corresponds to the class definition and the mini-application
itself to the class declaration. Like objects in object-oriented
programming languages, actors can access other actors’ data (if they are
public) and call methods.</p>
<p>All actors MUST have a globally, unique root URI. The root URI can be in
the form of a http or https URL, or any other type of URI that can allow
two-way communication and which are specified in this or associated
specifications. The root of the URI SHALL uniquely identify the actual
actor, i.e. the mini-application instance:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.actingweb.net/miniapp1/my_actor_id/">http://www.actingweb.net/miniapp1/my_actor_id/</a>. In the case of an
email, the full email address SHALL uniquely identify the instance:
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:my_actor_id&#37;&#52;&#48;Actingweb&#46;net">mailto:my_actor_id<span>&#64;</span>Actingweb<span>&#46;</span>net</a>.</p>
<p>The same holds for SIP URIs, example: <a class="reference external" href="sip:my_actor_id&#64;actingweb.net">sip:my_actor_id&#64;actingweb.net</a> or
possibly <a class="reference external" href="sip:myapp&#64;actingweb.net;gruu=my_actor_id">sip:myapp&#64;actingweb.net;gruu=my_actor_id</a></p>
</section>
<section id="identity">
<h3>Identity<a class="headerlink" href="#identity" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each actor’s root URI MUST be globally routable and, unless the actor is
offline, behind NAT or otherwise, a request to this URI MUST reach the
actor. Each actor MUST have an id that is created at creation
(instantiation) and which is valid throughout the lifetime of the actor.</p>
<p>The id MUST be globally unique. It is RECOMMENDED that a version 5
(SHA-1) UUID (RFC 4122) is used with the base URI of the location of
actor as name input to the algorithm. The resulting UUID MUST be added
to the base URI using the standard encoding. Example:
<em>​</em><a class="reference external" href="http://actingweb.net/myapp/f81d4fae7dec11d0a76500a0c91e6bf6">http://actingweb.net/myapp/f81d4fae7dec11d0a76500a0c91e6bf6</a></p>

<section id="data-representation">
<h3>Data Representation<a class="headerlink" href="#data-representation" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>All input and output representation specified throughout this document
MUST by in UTF-8 unless otherwise specified. The default data
representation is the JSON format and MUST be supported. Alternative
data representations, like urlencoded form-data, XML or others, can also
be supported and MAY be announced as a capability through the formats
element in /meta/actingweb (see /meta endpoint section). Content formats
should be negotiated with standard http header mechanisms.</p>
</section>
<section id="instantiation-of-actors">
<h3>Instantiation of Actors<a class="headerlink" href="#instantiation-of-actors" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Actors can be instantiated in several ways dependent on their context
and environment. For example, an installed application on a computer or
mobile phone that implements a mini-application as an actor, is
instantiated the first time it runs. Such instantiation is based on
installing the software on a new device, a factory- or manual process.</p>
<p>Actors that reside on a web server MUST implement dynamic instantiation
through a mini-application factory present at the level right above the
actors’ root URIs, ex: <em>​</em><a class="reference external" href="http://www.actingweb.net/miniapp1">http://www.actingweb.net/miniapp1</a>. The actor
or client requesting instantiation sends an http POST to the factory URI
with the following OPTIONAL application/json data:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>{
  “creator”: “username”,
  “passphrase”: “secret”,
  “trustee_root”: “uri”
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A special creator user with username “creator” and passphrase “secret”
MUST have full access to manage and access the actor through http basic
authentication. If “creator” is not supplied, “creator” MUST be the
default username.</p>
<p>The ‘trustee_root’ value is a URI pointing to the root URI of an actor that
will act as a validator and manager of trust relationships for the new
actor. This is typically used when another actor is instantiating a new
actor to get access to some new functionality.</p>
<p>If the creation of a new instance was successful, a 201 Created MUST be
returned with the <em>Location</em> header set to the full root URI of the new
actor instance. If the instantiation failed due to problems with the
input parameters, a 400 Bad Request MUST be returned. Temporary problems
in instantiating a new actor SHOULD result in a 503 Service Temporarily
Unavailable. Other server errors SHOULD result in the 500 Internal
Server Error return code.</p>
</section>
<section id="deleting-actor-instances">
<h3>Deleting Actor Instances<a class="headerlink" href="#deleting-actor-instances" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>An actor instance can be deleted with all its data by sending a DELETE
request to the root URI of the actor. The request MUST be authenticated
and only the creator or ‘admin’ relationships are allowed to delete an
actor (see the section on trust relationships). Upon receiving a valid
DELETE, the actor SHOULD clean up its data, any 3<sup>rd</sup> party
webhooks, and stop responding to requests on and below its root URI. If
the actor is deleted after being migrated to a newer version/new actor,
it MAY choose to respond with 301 Moved Permanently where the Location
header is set to the root URI of the new actor.</p>

<section id="endpoints">
<h3>Endpoints<a class="headerlink" href="#endpoints" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>ActingWeb actors communicate by sending http requests to each other on
pre-defined URI paths with pre-defined meanings and representations.
These messages can be sent over http/https or any other transport that
can support such exchanges.</p>
<p>The available endpoints are the most important structural elements of
the protocol specification. Any actor or client will expect another
actor implemented according to the ActingWeb specification to respond to
a certain set of paths right beneath the root URI of the actor. These
so-called endpoints have a defined purpose and use, and the use of http
methods and representations are specified in this document.</p>
<p>Below is a summary of the defined endpoints and a summary of their
purpose. Details on how to use these endpoints can be found later in
this specification in the Endpoints chapter, as well as separate
chapters for /trust and /subscriptions. Each of the OPTIONAL access
paths has a corresponding options tag (as found in
meta/actingweb/supported) with the same name as the path. I.e. if the
/www path is implemented, the meta/actingweb/supported options MUST
include “www” as an options tag.</p>

<h3>Agents<a class="headerlink" href="#agents" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Agents are actors that together with a proxy implement a
mini-application fully and according to the principles outlined in this
specification. Together, an agent/proxy pair MUST implement all
mandatory aspects of the mini-application. However, as opposed to the
actor, agents MAY be temporarily unavailable or accessible only through
an actor acting as a proxy for the agent. For simpler functionality and
low-powered devices, a client can instead be used. It can be as simple
as just holding credentials that allow updating values, e.g. posting GPS
coordinates once in a while through a POST.</p>
</section>
<section id="proxies">
<h3>Proxies<a class="headerlink" href="#proxies" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>A proxy is an actor that implements /meta, /properties, /trust, and
/subscriptions according to the definition of a mini-application, and
that has a special proxy relationship with an agent that is just
partially available to other actors. Together, the proxy and the agent
MUST implement the mini-application fully. These two actors, the proxy
and the agent, together form a pair representing the same entity or
data. The proxy MUST be available to other actors on the Internet
through a URI (or on a meaningfully defined private network), while the
agent can be intermittently unavailable and will typically only
communicate with its proxy. They MUST have a two-way trust relationship
of the type proxy.</p>
<p>An important characteristics of a proxy is that it MAY be implemented
totally generically for any type mini-application and only needs a
configuration that defines the /properties endpoint to respond to. In
this case, all other endpoints like /actions, /resources etc will just
be proxied to its agent. However, a proxy MAY implement more
mini-application specific functionality to offload from the agent or if
it otherwise makes sense.</p>
<p>A paired proxy and the agent SHOULD have implicit subscriptions to each
others /properties access paths in order to synchronise their
/properties data.</p>
<p><strong>Being a Proxy For Endpoints Proxied To The Agent</strong></p>
<p>A proxy MAY implement endpoints on behalf of the proxy/agent pair. These
MUST be implemented just like any other actor. However, a proxy MAY also
implement endpoints that are proxied to the agent that is not available
directly. Such a request to a path like /actions/dosumthin MUST give a
http 307, Temporarily Moved. This indicates to the requestor that this
is a proxy, and that the request should be sent as a subscription
creation request to /subscriptions using the path as target (target =
actions, sub-target=dosumthin) and with the parameter “proxied” set to
true in the payload. If the proxy sees a subscription request with the
parameter proxied set to true, it MUST treat the “data” element of the
payload in the subscription request as the original payload to the
endpoint, and thus forward this payload to the agent when forwarding.</p>

<h3>/properties (MUST)<a class="headerlink" href="#properties-must" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Quick interactions between actors are important in ActingWeb. The
/properties access path facilitates easy read and write of simple data.
If you need to read and write more complex data structures or XML
documents, you can use the access paths /resources (for RESTful access
to data) or /methods (for RPC-style access like SOAP and XMLRPC).</p>
<p>The /properties path is meant to contain the basic, most important data
for the actor’s functionality. Most often a newly instantiated actor
needs some properties set before proper functioning. However,
/properties is not for static configurations only, but also for dynamic
data. This implies that the actor MUST use current /properties data in
its execution (and not treat them as a configuration file).</p>
<p>The /properties path supports the http methods GET, PUT, DELETE, and
POST. The requests can be unauthorised or authorised through a trust
relationship by presenting credentials in the Authorization header of
the http method.</p>
<p>All attributes under /properties MUST be writable by the admin role.</p>
<p><strong>Attribute/value pairs</strong></p>
<p>The properties that can be stored under /properties are untyped, UTF-8
encoded attribute/value pairs. The semantics of the attribute/value pair
(as defined in the mini-application definition) must be used to convert
representations into their specific types, for example a
string-representation of an integer (“1234”) into the integer value
1234.</p>
<p>The below table shows the relationship between the attribute name, it’s
value, and the URI where the value is stored.</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<tbody>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p><strong>Attribute</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>Value</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>URI to attribute</strong></p></td>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p><strong>name</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Alice</p></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that to facilitate use of proxies, actors MUST NOT apply any logic
or process on semantics when a property is changed using PUT or POST.
Syntax SHOULD be checked. This implies that any processing logic in an
actor using /properties values must assume that the values can be
semantically invalid or even harmful and must do error handling
accordingly.</p>
<p>A mini-application MAY choose to support the value for each attribute as
either a blob or a json structure and must indicate in the returned
MIME-type whether the returned value is text/plain, application/json, or
any other content. A GET on /properties MUST return a proper
application/json document with all the attribute value pairs. A
mini-application MAY also support targeting nested json structs in the
path, i.e. /properties/address/street/number, but MUST not assume that
such support is present in peer actors. Such support SHOULD be announced
as an options tag, <em>nestedproperties</em>.</p>
<p><strong>GET</strong></p>
<p>GET methods are used to retrieve properties. A GET can be done for a
specific attribute or for the whole set of attributes. The response MUST
be a 200 OK with a body of content type application/json.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>When a GET request targets an attribute, the returned representation is
the value of that specific attribute only using text/plain as content
type: GET /app/78hjh76yug/properties/firstname</p>
<p>A GET for an empty /properties (i.e. no attribute/value pairs set) or a
GET for a non-set attribute should result in a 404 Not found from the
actor. If the attribute is not accessible without a trust relationship,
a 401 Unauthorised MUST be returned. If the request’s current trust
relationship is not sufficient, a 403 Forbidden MUST be returned.</p>
<p><strong>PUT</strong></p>
<p>The PUT method is used to add or change an attribute/value pair. A PUT
to an existing attribute will change the value of that attribute.</p>
<p>All actors MUST accept PUT requests to change a specific element.
Successful change of the value MUST result in a 201 Created response.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Example</span><span class="p">:</span>

<span class="n">PUT</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">78</span><span class="n">hjh76yug</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">properties</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">firstname</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A PUT request to an attribute name not supported by the actor MUST
result in a 404 Not Found. If the attribute is not writable without a
trust relationship, a 401 Unauthorised MUST be returned. If the
request’s current trust relationship is not sufficient, a 403 Forbidden
MUST be returned.</p>
<p>A PUT body can be of type application/json and MAY be stored as a blob
by the mini-app, however, it MAY support nested json and thus MAY also
support PUT /app/78hjh76yug/properties/people/person1/firstname</p>
<p><strong>POST</strong></p>
<p>The POST method is used to add or change a collection of attribute/value
pairs. Only the /properties root endpoint MUST support POST. Content
type application/json MUST be supported and
application/x-www-form-urlencoded MAY be supported if the application
supports web-based interactions. Successful change of all the values
MUST result in a 201 Created response. An error on one or more values
MUST result in no values changed and 409 Conflict returned.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Example</span><span class="p">:</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Any non-supported attribute names MUST result in a 400 Bad Request. If
any of the attributes are not writable without a trust relationship, a
401 Unauthorised MUST be returned. If the request’s current trust
relationship is not sufficient, a 403 Forbidden MUST be returned.</p>
</section>
<section id="actions-optional">
<h3>/actions (OPTIONAL)<a class="headerlink" href="#actions-optional" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Choosing between the /actions or other endpoints like /methods and
/resources cannot be done according to clear-cut rules, but each
endpoint has some restrictions that may or may not suit what you are
trying to accomplish and the one matching what you are trying to do, is
the best.</p>
<p>The /actions path is dedicated to operations or actions that not only
changes the state of a resource or updates a database, but where
triggering the action actually does something outside the actor. An
example may be a video recorder where its actor can be requested to
record on a specific channel at a specific time.</p>
<p>Any action below the /actions path (ex. /actions/record) MUST respond to
POST. This will create or execute a new action. The data representation
to be used in the body of the POST is specific to the mini-application.
If the actor offers a callback functionality for status updates, the
callback URL should be included in the request data representation. The
/callbacks endpoint MAY be used by adding an element to the path, e.g.
/callbacks/actions.</p>
<p>A successful action MUST return 201 Created. The body of the response
MAY contain a mini-application specific data representation detailing
the outcome of the action. The response MAY include a Location header
pointing to a URL representing the action requested (e.g.
/actions/record /3421433). This URL MUST respond to GET requests
containing a representation of the action status/progress. The data
representation is specified by the mini-application. If allowed, the
cancellation of an action SHOULD be available through a DELETE request
to the given location, while a PUT to the specific action URI MAY be
used to change the action while in progress (for example, temporarily
suspend a process).</p>
</section>
<section id="callbacks-optional">
<h3>/callbacks (OPTIONAL)<a class="headerlink" href="#callbacks-optional" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When an actor is requesting subscriptions, actions, sessions or other
functions where a callback is required, the actor MUST create a new leaf
node under the /callbacks path. The URI MUST expect POST requests with a
data representation according to the requested path the callback was
established for. It is up to the mini-application to keep track of the
format expected for each callback by establishing sub-paths below
/callbacks, e.g. /callbacks/subscriptions/… to handle callbacks on
subscriptions and so on.</p>
<p>All requests to /callbacks from other actors or clients MUST be
authenticated using the shared secret as bearer token (<em>Authorization
Bearer xxxxxxx</em>) or be an anonymous POST from a non-ActingWeb
application. All /callbacks requests without authentication data MUST
return 401 Authentication required, regardless of the callback URI
exists or not. Requests for non-existent /callbacks URIs with
authentication data SHOULD always return 403 Forbidden.</p>
<p>Differentiating between various types of callbacks and authentication
SHOULD be done be adding a path to callbacks/, e.g.
callbacks/{callback_type}.</p>
<p>A successfully received POST MUST result in a 204 No Content or 200 Ok
(with content). The actor pushing the callback will then clear the
callback.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Example of a callback:

1. Actor B is interested in actor A&#39;s /properties and establishes a
  subscription on actor A&#39;s /properties. A callback is established by B

2. Actor A&#39;s /properties/firstname changes and it uses B&#39;s callback
  URI to notify about the change

Actor B thus receives a POST request on its callback URL (Actor B’s root
URI is
http://www.actingweb.net/myapp/f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf.
Actor A’s id is 9f1c331a3e3b5cf38d4c3600a2ab5d54:

  ​
Bob

204 No content

Actor B receives the content in POST (in the case of /properties
changes, the content is application/json) and can immediately identify
this as a callback from actor A, as well as identify the specific
subscription this is a callback for.

<section id="sessions-optional">
<h3>/sessions (OPTIONAL)<a class="headerlink" href="#sessions-optional" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The /sessions access path is reserved for session-type communication
between two actors and will always have two parties. The purpose is to
enable two actors to create a way to share state and keep track of that
state over time. An actor can provide a session type by exposing the
session type right below the /sessions path, ex. /sessions/im to
identify im, instant messaging sessions. This location MUST respond to
POST requests by returning 201 Created with a Location header pointing
to a newly created session, ex.
/sessions/&lt;requesting-actors-id&gt;/fbe654aacef where fbe654aacef is a
session id uniquely identifying this session.</p>
<p>The POST request MAY have an application/json body containing a callback
URI that is URL-encoded (“callback”: “uri”). If not, the requesting
actor MUST respond to requests on the “mirrored” URL,
/sessions/&lt;requested-actors-id&gt;/&lt;sessionid&gt;, and the requested actor
MUST start sending session-related requests to this URL. If the session
creation fails, a 400 Bad request MUST be returned, or if the failure is
caused by a server problem, 500 Internal Server Error SHOULD be
returned.</p>
<p>Subsequent communication between the two actors SHOULD continue on the
returned new session URI and callback URIs using http methods and data
representations as specified by the actors’ mini-applications.
Extensions may specify the http methods and data representations for
specific type sessions and it is RECOMMENDED that if such extensions
exist, the actors use the extension to facilitate session-type exchanges
between different types of mini-applications.</p>
<p>A DELETE request to the session URI MUST terminate the session and
return a 200 Ok. If there was a problem terminating the session, a 500
Internal Server Error SHOULD be returned.</p>
<p>Sessions may of course be established outside the ActingWeb actor
implementation. The actor MAY choose to expose on-going sessions on
other protocols through the /sessions path to allow simple signalling
and session updates without the explicit creation of the session as
described above. An example could be a SIP-based calling application
where an on-going session (for example an instant messaging session) can
be exposed through the URI /sessions/<em>SIP Call-Id</em>. This can for example
allow non-SIP actors to insert messages into the dialog.</p>

actor communication, but rather allows humans to interact with the actor
in a simple way. An actor may choose to expose a full web application
below this path.</p>
<p>The /www path does not have any particular restrictions except on
/www/init, see next section.</p>
<p><strong>/www/init</strong></p>
<p>If the /www/init path exists, it MUST present a human-readable form with
/properties as the defined html form action. The path MUST be
authenticated using HTTP DIGEST with username ‘creator’ (or the username
established as the creator) and the passphrase as set when the actor was
instantiated.</p>
<p>This form is intended to allow a newly created actor to be initialised
by a human being with data in /properties. Thus, when submitting the
form, the forms data will be sent to /properties in a POST request.
Mini-applications supported this type of initialisation MUST, in
addition to application/json, support POST of forms data to /properties.</p>
</section>
<section id="oauth-optional">
<h3>/oauth (OPTIONAL)<a class="headerlink" href="#oauth-optional" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The /oauth endpoint is used if the mini-application supports attaching
to a 3<sup>rd</sup> party service using OAuth for authorisation. This way,
an actor can easily expose services to other actors, e.g. a
mini-application can offer users to create an actor that represent them
towards a text-messaging service and thus easily allow other actors or
clients to send text-messages to that user (or on behalf of the user).
Such an actor could for example expose /actions/message_me to allow
other actors to send text messages to the user who has (OAuth)
authorised the actor.</p>
<p>Similar to the /www endpoint, the /oauth endpoint assumes human
interaction as the actor should redirect to the 3<sup>rd</sup> party
service’s OAuth authorisation web page if a valid oauth token is not
found for this actor. Obvisoulty, this page may be embedded in an
application.</p>
<p>The /oauth endpoint MUST be able to handle the OAuth2 flow with a
redirect back where the code URL parameter is set. It is RECOMMENDED
that the mini-application offers a root URL /oauth (i.e.
actingweb.net/myapp/oauth) that can be used as the callback URL
registered with the 3<sup>rd</sup> party OAuth service and that the state
parameter in the initial OAuth2 request (see the OAuth2 specification)
is set to the actor’s id). This special root URL can then parse the
actor id from the state parameter and redirect to
actingweb.net/myapp/&lt;actor-id&gt;/oauth?code=… where processing of the code
can be done and the final token request to the 3<sup>rd</sup> party
service can be done.</p>

<section id="trust-model">
<h3>Trust Model<a class="headerlink" href="#trust-model" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Trust relationships form the basis of interaction between actors and is
the primary reason for why accounts (with usernames and passwords) are
not necessary. Each actor only needs to know the relationships itself
has to other actors (with the exception of the creator user
credentials). The trust relationship credentials are then used in all
communication between the actors using existing methods for
authentication.</p>
<p>Each actor (agent or proxy) is responsible for its own set of trust
relationships with other actors. Each relationship is bi-directional
where one actor initiates a trust relationship that then needs to be
approved by the other actor. A mini-application can choose to implement
one-way trust levels if necessary for its application, but this is not
mandatory to implement. Each actor is responsible for storing and
recognising actors it has trust relationships with. Each trust
relationship has one out of a set of trust levels as defined in this
specification.</p>
<p>A newly formed actor has no trust relationships, and new relationships
are formed by requesting a trust relationship. The request is processed
by the actor and the request can be approved in real-time or at a later
time.</p>
<p>Once a trust relationship has been granted, the actor includes
authentication details in all subsequent requests through a bearer
token. Access to an actor’s resources can thus be granted based on the
relationship.</p>
<p>Trust relationships are managed authoritatively by the actor that
granted the request, and a relationship can be revoked unilaterally at
any time by either the granting or accepting actor.</p>
<p>This specification specifies how to use the http Bearer token method for
authentication after exchanging a shared secret as part of the trust
relationship creation. An optional verification process is also
specified to ensure that both actors can trust the authenticity of the
domain hosting the actor. Using https, the actors can mutually assure
that their root URIs are correct. However, this specification does not
specify how an actor decides on whether a given domain should be
trusted. Also, while the methods described here are sufficient for most
Internet-based applications, the specification does not provide methods
on a security level where each request’s integrity can be assured.</p>

<h3>Determining Which Relationship to Request<a class="headerlink" href="#determining-which-relationship-to-request" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The definition of the mini-application SHOULD contain information about
what type of access is given for each type of trust relationship. The
actor requesting the access will have some knowledge of the
mini-application in order to use it, however, it may be useful to
request a human-readable description for each trust relationship
directly from the actor. This information can be presented to a user to
determine if a given trust relationship is desired or to choose which
relationship type to request. A GET to the uri of the trust relationship
type + /desc MAY return such a human-readable description. Unlike the
/meta/desc description, the text may be generic for the
mini-application.</p>

<h3>Creation of a Trust Relationship<a class="headerlink" href="#creation-of-a-trust-relationship" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When actor A wants to establish a trust relationship with B, it MUST
send a POST request (step 1 in table below) to B’s /trust/&lt;trustlevel&gt;.
The request does not carry authentication and has an application/json
body. Actor B responds (step 2). If actor B through the request can
immediately approve the relationship, it MUST respond with 201 Created.
If actor B immediately can deny the request, a 403 Forbidden MUST be
returned. If the request is well-formed and actor B is ready and willing
to process the request, B MUST respond with 202 Accepted. In both cases,
the URL of the newly created relationship MUST be returned in the
Location header in the response. The URL MUST be formatted the following
way: /&lt;baseuri-with-actor-id&gt;/trust/&lt;trustlevel&gt;/&lt;requesting-actor-id&gt;.</p>
<p>If the requested actor wants to do a verification of the requesting
actor, it MUST use baseuri, id, secret, and verify attributes to do a
GET request to &lt;baseuri&gt;/trust/&lt;trustlevel&gt;/&lt;requested-actor-id&gt; using
the secret as the Bearer token in the Authorization header. If the
requesting actor supports verification, it MUST accept a GET request to
this “reverse” URL, verify the shared secret, and then return the same
secret as sent in “verify” as part of the trust relationship request, in
the “verificationToken” attribute. If verification is not supported, the
regular trust relationship attributes should be returned in
application/json content.</p>
<p>B will later try to notify A about an approved trust relationship at the
reverse URI /&lt;requestor-id&gt;/trust/&lt;trustlevel/&lt;requested-actor-id&gt;, or a
GET poll to the relationship’s URL can be used to retrieve status.</p>

I.e. if the request has not yet been concluded or evaluated, 202
Accepted MUST be returned. If the relationship has been refused, 403

<p><strong>Verification</strong></p>
<p>Whether to do verification is up to the requested actor B. Actor A’s
provided baseuri parameter and Actor B’s id are used to create the
verification URI used in the above step 4. If Actor A wants to provide
verification (because B’s mini-application requires or recommends it),
it MUST, before sending the initial POST request, make sure that a GET
request to its ‘baseuri’/’ownid’/trust/’trustlevel’/’actorB-id’ will be
responded to with a 200 OK (step 1 in table above). The GET request MUST
be authenticated using the shared secret that actor A will send in the
POST request to B as bearer token, thus ensuring that only actor B can
request the URI.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Example:

Request to server `*​http://myserver.org/* &lt;http://myserver.org/&gt;`__ GET

200 Ok
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that by using https both in the initial trust creation and for the
verification, one can ensure that the root URIs of each of the actors
are authentic (through https session setup and certificate validation).
With appropriately loaded root certificates on each web server hosting
the actors, one can also selectively accept a group of servers and thus
actors. An actor may also choose to verify a trust relationship on
criteria or methods outside the scope of this specification.</p>
<p><strong>Notification of Result</strong></p>
<p>Once actor B has finalised the request for a relationship and if it
returned a 202 Accepted to actor A when receiving the initial POST
request, actor B MUST send a POST request to the same URI used for
verification with a application/json body containing the attribute
approved=True.</p>
<p><strong>Updating a Trust Relationship</strong></p>
<p>The actor owning the trust relationship can update the relationship by
sending a PUT request to the relationship URI with a application/json
body with attribute/value pairs of the attributes that are to be
changed. Normally, only baseuri, desc, and approved are the attributes
that can be changed.</p>
<p><strong>Reading Trust Relationship Data</strong></p>
<p>‘admin’ relationships and the ‘creator’ user MUST be allowed to read the
trust relationship data through an authenticated GET to
/myapp/’actorid’/trust/friend/’friendid’. Also the shared secret SHOULD
be readable to actors with these two relationships. If the shared secret
is not readable, the actor may not be able to support
versioning/migration of actors.</p>

<p><strong>Verification and Approval</strong></p>
<p>There are two mechanisms for validating a trust requests. As seen in the
above example, there are three attributes stored for each trust relationship:
<em>verified</em>, <em>peer_approved</em>, and <em>approved</em>. Verification is done as part of the initial
trust request where the receiving actor does a request back to the requesting actor
on the requesting actor’s trust URL. The shared secret and a verification token are
used as mutual authentication to verify that the two actors have a clear, trusted
communication channel.  The requesting actor is assumed to implicitly have verified
(or pre-verified, see below) the actor before sending a trust request and it’s verified
is true as default.</p>
<p>The approval is an explicit mutual approval that can happen automatically based on some
criteria (including passed verification) or through an external process either through
a trustee or a human. The <em>approved</em> attribute is set when the local actor has approved,
<em>peer_approved</em> is set when the peer actor has approved the relationship.</p>

<h3>Types of Relationships<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-relationships" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When a new relationship is requested by an actor, the relationship has a
type as specified in the URL path (i.e. /trust/friend/…). The actor
receiving the request supports a number of trust relationship types. The
mini-application’s definition SHOULD define exactly what a ‘friend’
relationship means in terms of access. For example, one mini-application
may allow ‘friends’ to update most of its properties, while another
mini-application may only allow ‘friends’ to read parts of the
properties.</p>
<p>In this section, a small number of relationship types are specified. It
is RECOMMENDED that mini-applications use these relationship types (and
fill them with own meaning), but only the ‘admin’ relationship type
(besides the ‘creator’ user) MUST be supported. If the mini-application
requires more relationship types, it MAY define new relationship types
and specify these in its definition. The guidelines for how to use the
specified relationship types should thus be used as a recommendation. It
is also conceivable that mini-applications allow actor instances to
dynamically change what each trust relationship gives access to. Such
dynamic access rights SHOULD be documented in the mini-application
definition, but is beyond the scope of this specification.</p>
<p>Below is an overview of the trust relationships. There are only three
regular trust relationships meant for access to mini-application
functionality/operations: associate, friend, and partner. The proxy and
admin relationships have special uses. An actor MAY NOT hold more than
one relationship with a given other actor.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>The Associate Relationship</strong></p>
<p>The associate relationship is the lowest relationship level. The rights
given to this relationship are dependent on the mini-application.
Validation of an associate may be limited as the damage an associate can
do should be very limited. Normally, an associate should not be able to
affect the operations of the actor beyond the scope of its own
relationship.</p>
<p>For example, a mini-application made to hold one person’s contact
information may allow read access to the person’s basic contact
information to anybody without a trust relationship, while an associate
may get access to the full business contact information. The associate
relationship can be used for creating networks of actors sharing
information. Ex. a two-way associate relationship between two actors
with contact information may allow a person to keep a real-time updated
address book if each actor subscribes to the others’ contact information
of interest.</p>
<p>Use of the associate relationship MAY be allowed either unapproved (i.e.
no explicit approbal) or auto-approved (possibly in combination with
lists of pre-approved base URIs).</p>
<p><strong>The Friend Relationship</strong></p>
<p>The friend relationship is an intermediate step from associate to a
partner relationship. The friend actor should be trusted to affect the
basic operations of an actor. The validation before approving a new
relationship should thus be appropriate for such access. Ex. a friend
may be allowed to ask the actor to initiate a new trust relationship
with another contact information actor. This would allow a trusted
contact to introduce a new friend.</p>
<p><strong>The Partner Relationship</strong></p>
<p>The partner relationship is the most trusted level that gives access to
actor operations. The partner may be trusted access to some or most of
the inner workings of the actor. Ex. a partner may be allowed to update
the actor’s contact information. This relationship can then be used to
implement synchronisation between different sources of a person’s
contact information. In particular, more dynamic contact information
like presence can then be updated. If each presence source (like a
mobile phone’s current profile or Messenger/AIM/Skype status) has an
actor representing the presence status, the contact information actor
can have partner relationships with each presence actor and allow
presence information to be consolidated in one place.</p>
<p><strong>The Proxy Relationship</strong></p>
<p>The proxy relationship is a reserved relationship between two actors of
the same mini-application type. A proxy relationship MUST always be
two-ways such that if one relationship fails, the other MUST be removed.
In a proxy relationship, the /properties access path SHOULD always be
synchronised through a one-way or two-way subscription (dependent on
application). These two subscriptions SHOULD be set up at the time of
creation of the proxy relationship. Once set up, the two actors act as
one entity to implement the mini-application’s functionality. See also
the section on the proxy actor.</p>
<p><strong>The Admin Relationship</strong></p>
<p>The admin relationship has full access to all data and functions of an
actor. See also the section on trustees as an alternative to using an
admin relationship as this approach allows access to managing
relationships without getting full access to the actor.</p>
<p>An admin relationship can also delete an actor (take it completely out
of action).</p>
<p><strong>The Creator Special User</strong></p>
<p>The creator user can only be established at the point of instantiating
an actor. The creator relationship has two primary objectives:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>other actors can instantiate a new actor and immediately administrate
the new actor</p></li>
<li><p>the creator credentials can be either supplied by a human user when
instantiating the actor or conveyed to a user and thus allow the user
to initialise the actor using the /www/init form or the web front-end
supplied by the actor at /www</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The creator MUST have all access rights similar to the ‘admin’
relationship. A creator is a user authenticated with username and
password, not a trust relationship. The default user name for a creator
is ‘creator’ unless another username is provided as part of the
instantiation of the actor.</p>
<p><strong>Assigning Individual Rights To An Instance Of A Trust Relationship</strong></p>
<p>A mini-application MAY implement assigning of rights to a specific
instance of a trust relationship (i.e. rights per actor). This allows
granular access control. For example allowing home contact information
to be available to some actors, while others only get access to business
information. Whether this granular access control is implemented
assigning a new type of trust relationship to a defined access group or
on an individual basis is outside the scope of this specification. The
same holds for how to determine which relationship to get upgraded or
reduced rights.</p>

<h3>Using a Trustee To Manage Relationships<a class="headerlink" href="#using-a-trustee-to-manage-relationships" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>The Use of Trustees</strong></p>
<p>Managing trust relationship request can be one of actor’s the most
complex operations and may require validation of the requesting actor’s
identity, seeking approval from a human or applying some other logic to
evaluate the request. Also, managing trust relationships over time
requires maintenance actions, for example deleting a relationship after
a certain time period or on a human’s request. To simplify this process,
another (possibly dedicated) actor called a ‘trustee’ can take over the
relationship management.</p>
<p>A trustee actor can take many forms, two examples may be:</p>
<p>1. A web application that presents a web page to a user and allows the
user to approve or reject the request. The user can be authenticated
using for example the Google Account API to validate Google credentials
for the Google account stored as the trustee’s “owner”.</p>
<p>2. A desktop application that graphically and dynamically depicts
relationships between actors and that allows a human being to create new
relationships through connecting and disconnecting icon representations
using drag and drop.</p>
<p>For example, a desktop application may allow a user to choose a bank
account as a focal point and then visualise drawn lines to actors that
represent subscription services that are allowed to withdraw money from
the bank account. Hoovering over the relationship line can show details
about the relationship, for example restrictions on amount and how often
money is allowed to be transferred.</p>
<p><strong>Assigning and Forwarding To a Trustee</strong></p>
<p>A trustee can be assigned either at the instantiation of an actor (by
specifying trustee root URI on instantiation in the application/json
body using the attribute ‘trustee_root’) or by changing the trustee’s
root URI by PUTing a new URI to /trust/trustee (an admin or creator
relationship is required) with application/json content and the URL in
the attribute ‘trustee_root’. In the same PUT, the ‘creator’ attribute
MUST also be available to allow changing creator to ‘trustee’.
The ‘creator’ user’s passphrase/secret MAY
then be used as a bearer token to do trustee REST requests if ‘creator’ is
set to ‘trustee’. As a passphrase is
supplied at instantiation time for creator, it is RECOMMENDED that the
passphrase is checked for security strength if the trustee_root
attribute is set.</p>
<p>However, the token MUST NOT give access as bearer token in requests unless
the ‘creator’ user is ‘trustee’ and the bit strength of the passphrase is &gt;
80 bits.</p>
<p>A trustee MUST have access to the /trust and /subscription endpoints, as well
as the root (like creator) using the passphrase as bearer token. It is
RECOMMENDED that any other endpoint access is done and accepted only with
a regular trust relationship.</p>
<p>It is RECOMMENDED that a trustee also establishes a regular relationship
with the actor (of any type). A mini-application MUST make this a
requirement before accepting any trustee access with a bearer token as a
trust relationship allows verification and possibly explicit approval
through an external process to set a trustee. (Note that if
trustee_root is set as part of an instantiation, the creator username
and password can be used to send requests as creator to the new actor
even before trustee access with passphrase as bearer token is allowed.)</p>
<p>A typical use of a trustee is automatic creation of a new actor by
another actor to create an ActingWeb network of actors. Let’s say a bot
instantiating a new text messaging actor before handing over to the user
to authenticate the new actor with the 3<sup>rd</sup> party text messaging
service. The actor instantiating a new actor may then initiate a new
trust relationship and then use the creator credentials to approve the
relationship directly.</p>
</section>
<section id="authentication">
<h3>Authentication<a class="headerlink" href="#authentication" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Authentication of an actor is necessary when the actor is sending a
request to another actor where a trust relationship is required to gain
the required access. At the time of creating a trust relationship, the
actor receiving and approving the request MUST store the actor’s id,
base URI, and the relationship’s shared secret in its authentication
store.</p>
<p>The authentication method is based on the http Bearer authentication
method. Please refer to <a class="reference external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750</a> for details
on the use of bearer tokens.</p>
<p>Note that the passphrase created at actor instantiation time together
with the (default) username ‘creator’ MUST use http basic
authentication.</p>

<h2>/subscriptions - Subscriptions (OPTIONAL)<a class="headerlink" href="#subscriptions-subscriptions-optional" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<section id="establishing-a-subscription">
<h3>Establishing a Subscription<a class="headerlink" href="#establishing-a-subscription" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The subscription model is based on the concept of creating a
subscription on a specific actor path with three elements: target,
sub-target, and resource. The most narrow subscription is on a resource.
Sub-target and target are then mandatory specified in the subscription
request. If a subscription targets all resources within a sub-target,
then sub-target and target are specified in the request. Finally, if the
entire endpoint is targeted in the subscription, only target is
specified in the request.</p>
<p>The /properties endpoint allows easy sharing of simple json data, while
the endpoints /actions, /resources, /methods, and /sessions enable
sharing of more complex data and execution of procedures. Once an actor
has a trust relationship, it can use subscriptions to receive updates
about changes and activities. The main use of a subscription is to make
sure that one actor gets efficient and near real-time access to changes
that occur to another actor.</p>
<p>An actor can establish a new subscription by sending a peer
authenticated POST request to /subscriptions/&lt;peerid&gt; where peerid is
the actor id of the requesting actor. A json body MUST as a minimum
include the attribute “target”. The most common targets are properties,
resources, actions, methods, and sessions, but a subscription MAY be of
any target the mini-app will recognise. Additionally, “subtarget” and
“resource” can be specified, thus identifying a sub-path to subscribe
to, e.g. /resources/folders/12345.</p>
<p>The “granularity” attribute controls how the subscribing actor wants to
be notified. The possible values are “high”, “low”, and “none”, where
“high” sends a callback to the subscribing actor with a full
application/json body of the update, “low” sends a notification with an
application/json body with a single attribute “url” with a URL to where
a full json body of the update can be retrieved, and “none” suppresses
all notifications and GET polling on the subscription is necessary to
retrieve updates. If “granularity” is not present, “none” is assumed.</p>
<p>The requesting actor MUST have a relationship allowing minimum read
permissions on the requested path, and the actor receiving the request
MUST validate the access rights upon receiving the request. It MUST also
validate that the bearer token is valid for the peer specified in the
POST URI.</p>
<p>If approved, a 201 Created MUST be returned with the Location header
pointing to the relative URI of the newly created subscription in the
format /&lt;actorid&gt;/subscriptions/&lt;subscriber-actor-id&gt;/&lt;subscription-id&gt;.</p>
<p>In the below example, a new subscription with id
9d60853cb4915b699f89d7ae13efb382 is created at actor (requested)
b373e63030a451b2991c9995438fccf1 from actor (requesting)

</div>
<p>An actor is RECOMMENDED to support callbacks, but MUST support polling
of subscriptions. If a callback is requested by specifying “granularity”
other than “none”, but it is not supported by the mini-application, a
501 Not Implemented MUST be returned. The requesting actor may then
choose to resend the subscription request without a granularity
attribute or {“granularity”: “none”}.</p>
<p>When a subscription has been registered, the actor MUST record and act
upon any changes that are done to the path. The actor MAY reject a
subscription request to any path on which it does not support
subscriptions. A subscription to /actions and /methods indicates a wish
to get updates on any requests to these paths.</p>

<section id="initiating-and-enumerating-subscriptions">
<h3>Initiating and Enumerating Subscriptions<a class="headerlink" href="#initiating-and-enumerating-subscriptions" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes it can be necessary to request an actor to create a
subscription with another actor. Actors supporting subscriptions MUST
support POST requests to /&lt;actorid&gt;/subscriptions with an
application/json body with “peerid” identifying the peer to send a
subscription request to, as well as all the attributes to use when
requesting a subscription.</p>
<p>It is RECOMMENDED that a mini-application supports GET on /subscriptions

respectively. The body returned with 200 Ok MUST contain the below
elements. See the next section for explanation of the sequence

<h3>Getting Subscription Updates<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-subscription-updates" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>The Diff and Update Model</strong></p>
<p>The hierarchy of subscriptions is important for how the subscription
callbacks and diffs work:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>|… ourtarget |… sub-target1 |… resource1
             |              |… resource2
             |              |… resource3
             |… sub-target2 |… resource1
                            |… resource2
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Let’s start with the simplest case, the subscription targets <em>resource1</em>
of <em>sub-target1</em> in <em>ourtarget</em>. The data in the body of an update MUST
in this case be the full resource representation (json or other data
representation) and not a diff. In fact, the data MAY be anything the
mini-app chooses to send as an update. It can be a blob or a data object
that has nothing to do with the previous subscription update, as long as
it communicates a state change on the resource, and the data
representation is documented by the mini-app.</p>
<p>This flexibility allows the subscription mechanism to be used for any
resource state change that is desired to be communicated to another
actor.</p>
<p>For subscriptions to a target or a sub-target, the expectation is that
the changes per update can be found in a json struct following the
hierarchy relative to the subscription. I.e. If resource2 in sub-target2
has changed, the diff MUST follow the following example format for a
subscription to <em>ourtarget</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;sub-target2&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;resource2&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;full_representation&quot;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and the following for a subscription to <em>ourtarget</em>, <em>sub-target2</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;resource2&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;full_representation&quot;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This means that every time something happens on a
resource/endpoint/path, all subscriptions within scope MUST be processed
and a specific diff created for each subscription where the json struct
follows the hierarchy below the subscription. The diff format is simple:
only sub-targets or resources that have changed are included in a diff,
and an empty attribute is defined as the same as a non-existent
attribute, thus an attribute can be deleted by setting it to “”.</p>
<p>Each diff MUST have a sequence number, where the number is 1 for each
new subscription and then incremented by 1 for each diff that is created
for this subscription.</p>

<p>Initial data POSTed to /properties:</p>

  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and the diff to a subscription on /properties MUST be:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="s2">&quot;test&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;var1&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;hey&quot;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And a subscription to /properties/test MUST give the following diff:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;var1&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;hey&quot;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If instead a PUT is done to /properties/test/var1 to change it to
“change2”, the subscription diff for a /properties subscription will be:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="s2">&quot;test&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;var1&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;change2&quot;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note here that the resource and var2 attributes in the test struct have
not been touched and are thus still present in test if you do a GET on
/properties. Compare this to the above example overwriting of the entire
test sub-target (with { “var1”: “hey” }), and you can see that there is
no way to determine if resources below test were deleted by just looking
at the diff. This information can be forced into a diff by doing a
DELETE on a /properties path (which MUST send a “resource”: “” as a
diff).</p>
<p>A mini-app MAY implement more advanced diff methods, but this diff
method MUST be used for the /properties endpoint.</p>
<p><strong>Getting the Updates</strong></p>
<p>There are two ways to get updates on a subscription: polling on the
subscription URI or receive callbacks on the subscription callback URI
as specified in the previous section.</p>
<p>If the granularity is set to high, the callback is a POST with peer
bearer authentication to the subscription URI with the following format:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;id&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;26597c23469e5ab2b3489b786cf553f5&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;target&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;properties&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;sequence&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;timestamp&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;2016-11-15T13:47:02.375880Z&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;granularity&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;high&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;subscriptionid&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;552a0d7ec4ab553ea6c912baeb4459eb&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;data&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;test&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="s2">&quot;resource&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;change5&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The data attribute contains the actual diff relative to the
subscription, while the other attributes identifies the actor id
originating the update, the target (and subtarget and resource if
relevant), the timestamp in UTC, the granularity of the subscription,
the subscriptionid, as well as the sequence number of the update. In
this case, 6 indicates that this is the 6<sup>th</sup> diff produced for
this specific subscription as identified by subscriptionid.</p>
<p>A peer bearer token authenticated GET on the subscription id MUST offer
a similar format, but here an array of data elements MUST represent one
or more diff updates. In the below example, the first diff was retrieved
earlier, now diff 2 - 6 are collected.</p>

</div>
<p>In the case of callbacks to the subscription callback URI, any 2xx
response from the actor will indicate that the update has been received,
and it MUST be cleared, i.e. not available anymore when doing a GET on
the subscription.</p>
<p>If the callback is not cleared with a 2xx response, the actor SHOULD not
retry, and it SHOULD be up to the receiving actor to do a GET poll when
it detects a gap in the sequence or triggered by another event. An actor
MAY implement a re-try mechanism with an exponential back-off.</p>
<p><strong>Low Granularity and Polling</strong></p>
<p>In the case of granulerity = low, the callback to the subscription
callback URI MUST contain application/json content with the following
format:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;subscriptionid&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;26f9bb085fb351c7ba40d395af18a381&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>

<p>The data element is here replaced by a url attribute identifying where
the subscribing actor can retrieve a specific diff. It is RECOMMENDED
that the URL is composed of the subscription URL with the sequence
number trailing at the end.</p>

subscription following this example:</p>

<p><strong>Clearing Callback Status</strong></p>
<p>Subsequent GET requests to the same URL MUST give the same result, both
requests to the subscription as well as to the specific diff URL, except
that the subscription URL MUST return new diffs.</p>
<p>When a GET is done either to the subscription URL or to a specific diff
and the subscribing actor wants to clear all diffs received, a PUT MUST
be sent to the subscription URL with an application/json body with one
attribute “sequence” and the sequence number that was the last sequence
retrieved. All diffs with lower and equal sequence number than this MUST
be cleared and no longer appear in GET requests to the subscription URL.
GET requests to the diff specific URL (subscription URL + ‘/seqnr’) MUST
return 404 Not found after clearing has been done.</p>

<h2>Security Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#security-considerations" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are many security considerations, some are well known for
any http-based communication, while some are specific to ActingWeb, in
particular the trust model.</p>
<p>The use of https is a MANDATORY requirement for any non-trivial implementation.
Some of the validation of peers MAY be based on validation of server-side
certificates. This require proper configuration of the web server hosting the
mini-app.</p>
<p>Validation and approval of a relationship MAY be based on three elements:
1. Root host of the requesting actor (confirmed by TLS certificate)
2. Callback verification
3. Explicit approval list, static or dynamic, of peer root URL
4. Manual approval</p>
<p>The use of a bearer token in the http Authorization header is subject to the
same security concerns as OAuth2 Bearer tokens.</p>
<p>Care must be taken to make sure that the bearer token is sufficiently random and
long enough for the security level required.</p>
<p>There is no expiry of ActingWeb peer tokens. However, the relationship can be
terminated at any time and thus offers a revocation method. Also, a mini-app
MAY enforce automatic expiry of relationships and thus force a new trust
establishment flow.</p>
<p><strong>Use of HTTP methods</strong></p>
<p>Some firewalls and proxies may filter http methods like PUT and DELETE
and may only allow GET and POST. Also, some application frameworks or
browsers may not support other methods. Wherever a method other than GET
and POST is specified in this document, the parameter
_method=’true_method’ MUST be supported and the http header X-HTTP-Method-Override:
‘true_method’ MAY be supported as alternative ways to specify the
intended http method.</p>

<section id="iana-considerations">
<h2>IANA Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#iana-considerations" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Currently, ActingWeb.org controls the namespaces that IANA might be
responsible for. Dependent on how this specification is moved forward,
that may or may not change.</p>
