initiate creation of an actor (or to do commands that don't need personal oauth authorization.

Oct 12, 2016
--------------
- Support for actor.get_from_property(property-name, value) to initialse an actor from db by looking up a property value
(it must be unique)

also below resource, i.e. /properties/<subtarget>/<resource>/something/andmore/...
- Fixed bug where blob='', i.e. deletion, would not be registered

Oct 7, 2016
--------------
- Added support for resource (in addition to target and subtarget) in subscriptions, thus allowing subscriptions to

can be used insted of oauth.getRequest(), postRequest(), and deleteRequest()
- Minor refactoring of inner workings of auth.py and oauth.py wrt return values and error codes

Sep 25, 2016
--------------
- Added use_cache=False to all db operations to avoid cache issue when there are multiple instances of same app in gae

Sep 4, 2016
--------------
- Refactoring of creation of trust:
  - ensure that secret is generated by initiating peer
  - ensure that a peer cannot have more than one relationship
  - ensure that a secret can only be used for one relationship

Aug 28, 2016
--------------
- Major refactoring of auth.py. Only affects how init_actingweb() is used, see function docs

Aug 21, 2016: New features
--------------------------
- Removed the possibility of setting a secret when initiating a new relationship, as well as ability to change secret. This is to avoid the possibility of detecting existing secrets (from other peers) by testing secrets

Aug 15, 2016: Bug fixes
------------------------
- Added new acl["approved"] flag to auth.py indicating whether an authenticated peer has been approved
- Added new parameter to the authorise() function to turn off the requirement that peer has been approved to allow access
- Changed default relationship to the lowest level (associate) and turned off default approval of the default relationship
- Added a new authorisation check to subscriptions to make sure that only peers with access to a path are allowed to subscribe to those paths
- Added a new approval in trust to allow non-approved peers to delete their relationship (in case they want to "withdraw" their relationship request)
- Fixed uncaught json exception in createRemoteSubscription()
- Fixed possibility of subpath being None instead of '' in auth.py
- Fixed handling of both bool json type and string bool value for approved parameter for trust relationships


Aug 6, 2016: New features
----------------------------
- Support for deleting remote subscription (i.e. callback and subscription, dependent on direction) when an actor is deleted
  - New deleteRemoteSubscription() in actor.py
  - Added deletion to actor.delete()
  - New handler for DELETE of /callbacks in aw-actor-callbacks.py
  - New on_delete_callbacks() in on_aw_callbacks.py

Aug 6, 2016: Bug fixes
----------------------------
- Fixed bug where /meta/nonexistent resulted in 500

Aug 3, 2016: New features
----------------------------
- Support for doing callbacks when registering diffs
  - New function in actor.py: callbackSubscription()
  - Added defer of callbacks to avoid stalling responses when adding diffs
  - Added new function getTrustRelationship() to get one specific relationship based on peerid (instead of searching using getTrustRelationships())
- Improved diff registration
  - Totally rewrote registerDiffs() to register diffs for subscriptions that are not exact matches (i.e. broader/higher-level and more specific)
  - Added debug logging to trace how diffs are registered
- Owner-based access only to /callbacks/subscriptions
- Support for handling callbacks for subscriptions
  - New function in on_aw_callbacks.py: on_post_subscriptions() for handling callbacks on subscriptions
  - Changed aw-actor-callbacks.py to handle POSTs to /callbacks/subscriptions and forward those to on_post_subscriptions()

Aug 3, 2016: Bug fixes
----------------------------
- Added no cache to the rest of subscriptionDiffs DB operations to make sure that deferred subscription callbacks don't mess up sequencing
- Changed meta/raml to meta/specification to allow any type of specification language

Aug 1, 2016: New features
----------------------------
- Added support for GET on subscriptions as peer, generic register diffs function, as well as adding diffs when changing /properties. Also added support for creator initiating creation of a subscription by distingushing on POST to /subscriptions (as creator to inititate a subscription with another peer) and to /subscriptions/<peerid> (as peer to create subscription)
- Subscription is also created when initiating a remote subscription (using callback bool to set flag to identify a subscription where callback is expected). Still missing support for sending callbacks (high/low/none), as well as processing callbacks
- Added support for sequence number in subscription, so that missing diffs can be detected. Specific diffs can be retrieved by doing GET as peer on /subscriptions/<peerid>/<subid>/<seqnr> (and the diff will be cleared)

Jul 27, 2016: New features
----------------------------
- Started adding log statements to classes and methods
- Added this file to track changes
- Added support for requesting creation of subscriptions, GETing (with search) all subscriptions as creator (not peer), as well as deletion of subscriptions when an actor is deleted (still remaining GET all relationship as peer, GET on relationship to get diffs, DELETE subscription as peer, as well as mechanism to store diffs)

Jul 27, 2016: Bug fixes
----------------------------
- Changed all ndb.fetch() calls to not include a max item number
- Cleaned up actor delete() to go directly on database to delete all relevant items
- Fixed a bug where the requested peer would not store the requesting actor's mini-app type in db (in trust)
- Added use_cache=False in all trust.py ndb calls to get rid of the cache issues experienced when two different threads communicate to set up a trust
- Added a new check and return message when secret is not included in an "establish trust" request (requestor must always include secret)

July 12, 2016: New features
----------------------------
- config.py cleaned up a bit

July 12, 2016: Bug fixes
----------------------------
- Fix in on_aw_oauth_success where token can optionally supplied (first time oauth was done the token has not been flushed to db)
- Fix in on_aw_oauth_success where login attempt with wrong Spark user did not clear the cookie_redirect variable
- Fixed issue with wrong Content-Type header for GET and DELETE messages without json body
