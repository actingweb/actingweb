# Unified Access Control System - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document reflects the **completed implementation** of the simplified Unified Access Control System for ActingWeb. The system provides transparent permission checking integrated with ActingWeb's existing hook architecture.

## Project Status

- **Total Duration**: 4 weeks (completed)
- **Approach**: Simplified, transparent integration
- **Team**: 1 developer with user feedback

## Phase 1: Foundation Layer ✅ COMPLETED

### Goals ✅ ACHIEVED
Established core data models and storage system using existing ActingWeb patterns with simplified developer experience.

### Tasks ✅ COMPLETED

#### 1.1 Trust Type Registry Using Attribute Buckets ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Actual Duration**: 2 days (simplified approach)

- ✅ Use attribute buckets instead of system actors for global storage
- ✅ Implement trust type storage with standardized ACTINGWEB_SYSTEM_ACTOR

- ✅ Build permission caching layer for performance
- ✅ Implement trust lookup methods (by actor/peer combinations)
- ✅ Write comprehensive unit tests

**Files Implemented**:
- ✅ `actingweb/trust_permissions.py` (implemented)

## Cleanup Plan (In Progress)

### Goals
Clarify OAuth2 lifecycle, avoid duplicate trust creation, and keep web Google auth usable without creating trusts by default. Centralize state handling and trust creation.

### Actions
- Introduce a single OAuth state helper to encode/decode/validate state across web and MCP flows.
- Centralize trust creation in a single manager; all handlers delegate to it.
- Lifecycle rules:
  - Web/Google (`/<actor_id>/www`, POST `/`): authenticate user, do not create a trust unless state contains an explicit `trust_type`.
  - MCP OAuth: create/refresh trust at token issuance (authorization_code exchange) using `trust_type` from state (default `mcp_client`).
  - REST API: existing actor↔actor trust endpoints unchanged.
- Standardize peer identifiers and token storage conventions.
- Remove duplicated state parsing and trust creation logic from handlers.

### Backward Compatibility
- Actor↔Actor trusts via REST remain unchanged and can coexist with Actor↔MCP trusts.
- Existing tokens and relationships continue to work; legacy token keys read and re-saved on first use.
